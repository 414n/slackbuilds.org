RCCL (pronounced "Rickle") is a stand-alone library of standard
collective communication routines for GPUs, implementing all-reduce,
all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter, gather, scatter, and
all-to-all. There is also initial support for direct GPU-to-GPU send and
receive operations. It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on
platforms using PCIe, xGMI as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs
or TCP/IP sockets. RCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in
a single node or multiple nodes, and can be used in either single- or
multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
