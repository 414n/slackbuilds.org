rocPRIM is a header-only library that provides HIP parallel primitives.
You can use this library to develop performant GPU-accelerated code on
AMD ROCm platforms.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
