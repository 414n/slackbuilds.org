# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipsolver: hipsolver: ROCm SOLVER marshalling library
hipsolver:
hipsolver: hipSOLVER is a LAPACK marshalling library, with multiple supported
hipsolver: backends. It sits between the application and a 'worker' LAPACK
hipsolver: library, marshalling inputs into the backend library and marshalling
hipsolver: results back to the application. hipSOLVER exports an interface that
hipsolver: does not require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
hipsolver: backend. Currently, hipSOLVER supports rocSOLVER and cuSOLVER as
hipsolver: backends.
