hipSOLVER is a LAPACK marshalling library, with multiple supported
backends. It sits between the application and a 'worker' LAPACK library,
marshalling inputs into the backend library and marshalling results back
to the application. hipSOLVER exports an interface that does not require
the client to change, regardless of the chosen backend. Currently,
hipSOLVER supports rocSOLVER and cuSOLVER as backends.
