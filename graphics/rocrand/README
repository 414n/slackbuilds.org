The rocRAND project provides functions that generate pseudorandom and
quasirandom numbers.

The rocRAND library is implemented in the HIP programming language and
optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs. It is designed to run on top of
AMD's ROCm runtime, but it also works on CUDA-enabled GPUs.

Prior to ROCm version 5.0, this project included the hipRAND wrapper. As
of version 5.0, it was split into a separate library.
