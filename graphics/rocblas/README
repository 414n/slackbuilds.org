rocBLAS is the ROCm Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library.
rocBLAS is implemented in the HIP programming language and optimized for
AMD GPUs.

NOTE: compilation is really CPU and disk intensive. Consider using a
different TMP directory if you have less than about 30GB available...

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
