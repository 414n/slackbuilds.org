ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for software)
or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like FPGAs or

WARNING: this build is extemely taxing both CPU-wise, RAM-wise and
disk-wise: make sure that your /tmp has at least 16GB free or use another
temporary directory overriding the TMP variable, i.e.:

TMP=/some/path ./rocm-llvm.SlackBuild
