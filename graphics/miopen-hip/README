AMD's library for high performance machine learning primitives.
MIOpen supports two programming models

  1. HIP (Primary Support)
  2. OpenCL

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./miopen-hip.SlackBuild
