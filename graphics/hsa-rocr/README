ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for software)
or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like FPGAs or
other CPU architectures).

These are the user-mode API interfaces and libraries necessary for host
applications to launch compute kernels to available HSA ROCm kernel
agents.
