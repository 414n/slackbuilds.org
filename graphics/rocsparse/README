rocSPARSE exposes a common interface that provides Basic Linear Algebra
Subroutines for sparse computation implemented on top of AMD's Radeon
Open eCosystem Platform ROCm runtime and toolchains. rocSPARSE is created
using the HIP programming language and optimized for AMD's latest
discrete GPUs.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
