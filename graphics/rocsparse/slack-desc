# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rocsparse: rocsparse: next generation SPARSE implementation for ROCm platform
rocsparse:
rocsparse: ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for
rocsparse: software) or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like
rocsparse: FPGAs or other CPU architectures).
rocsparse: rocSPARSE exposes a common interface that provides Basic Linear
rocsparse: Algebra Subroutines for sparse computation implemented on top of AMD's
rocsparse: ROCm runtime and toolchains. rocSPARSE is created using the HIP
rocsparse: programming language and optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs.
