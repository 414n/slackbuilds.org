Thrust is a parallel algorithm library. It has been ported to HIP and
ROCm, which use the rocPRIM library. The HIP-ported library works on HIP
and ROCm software. Currently there is no CUDA backend in place.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocthrust.SlackBuild
