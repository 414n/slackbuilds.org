# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rocthrust: Thrust is a parallel algorithm library. It has been ported to HIP and
rocthrust: ROCm, which use the rocPRIM library. The HIP-ported library works on
rocthrust: HIP and ROCm software. Currently there is no CUDA backend in place.
