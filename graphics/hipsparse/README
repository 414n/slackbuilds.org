hipSPARSE is a SPARSE marshalling library with multiple supported
backends. It sits between your application and a 'worker' SPARSE library,
where it marshals inputs to the backend library and marshals results to
your application. hipSPARSE exports an interface that doesn't require the
client to change, regardless of the chosen backend. Currently, hipSPARSE
supports rocSPARSE and cuSPARSE backends.
By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
