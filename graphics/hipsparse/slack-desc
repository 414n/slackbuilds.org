# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipsparse: hipsparse: ROCm SPARSE marshalling library
hipsparse:
hipsparse: ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for
hipsparse: software) or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like
hipsparse: FPGAs or other CPU architectures).
hipsparse: hipSPARSE is a SPARSE marshalling library with multiple supported
hipsparse: backends. It sits between your application and a 'worker' SPARSE
hipsparse: library, where it marshals inputs to the backend library and marshals
hipsparse: results to your application.
