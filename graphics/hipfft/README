hipFFT is an FFT marshalling library that supports rocFFT and cuFFT
backends.

hipFFT exports an interface that doesn't require the client to change,
regardless of the chosen backend. It sits between your application and
the backend FFT library, where it marshals inputs to the backend and
marshals results back to your application.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./hipfft.SlackBuild
