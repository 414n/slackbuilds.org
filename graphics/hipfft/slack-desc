# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipfft:
hipfft: hipFFT is an FFT marshalling library that supports rocFFT and cuFFT
hipfft: backends.
hipfft: hipFFT exports an interface that doesn't require the client to change,
hipfft: regardless of the chosen backend. It sits between your application and
hipfft: the backend FFT library, where it marshals inputs to the backend and
hipfft: marshals results back to your application.
