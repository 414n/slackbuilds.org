hipBLAS is a Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) marshalling library
with multiple supported backends. It sits between your application and a
'worker' BLAS library, where it marshals inputs to the backend library
and marshals results to your application. hipBLAS exports an interface
that doesn't require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
backend. Currently, hipBLAS supports rocBLAS and cuBLAS backends.
