ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for software)
or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like FPGAs or
other CPU architectures).

This package compiles both the ROCclr and ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime sources to
provide an OpenCL 2.0 compatible language runtime.

It supports offline and in-process/in-memory compilation.
