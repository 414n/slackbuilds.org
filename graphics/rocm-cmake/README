ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for software)
or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like FPGAs or
other CPU architectures).

rocm-cmake is a build dependency for many of the libraries that comprise
the ROCm platform. It is not required for building libraries or programs
that use ROCm.
