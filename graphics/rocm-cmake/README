rocm-cmake is a collection of CMake modules for common build and
development tasks within the ROCm project.

It is therefore a build dependency for many of the libraries that
comprise the ROCm platform.

rocm-cmake is not required for building libraries or programs that use
ROCm; it is required for building some of the libraries that are a part
of ROCm.
