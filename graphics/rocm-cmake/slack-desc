# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rocm-cmake:
rocm-cmake: rocm-cmake is a collection of CMake modules for common build and
rocm-cmake: development tasks within the ROCm project. It is therefore a build
rocm-cmake: dependency for many of the libraries that comprise the ROCm platform.
rocm-cmake: rocm-cmake is not required for building libraries or programs that use
rocm-cmake: ROCm; it is required for building some of the libraries that are a
rocm-cmake: part of ROCm.
