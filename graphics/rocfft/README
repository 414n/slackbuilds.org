rocFFT is a software library for computing fast Fourier transforms (FFTs)
written in the HIP programming language. It's part of AMD's software
ecosystem based on ROCm. The rocFFT library can be used with AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs.

By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
