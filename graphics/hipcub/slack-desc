# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hipcub: hipcub: reusable software components for ROCm developers 
hipcub:
hipcub: ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for
hipcub: software) or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like
hipcub: FPGAs or other CPU architectures).
hipcub: hipCUB is a thin wrapper library on top of rocPRIM or CUB. It enables
hipcub: developers to port a project using the CUB library to the HIP layer to
hipcub: run on AMD hardware. In the ROCm environment, hipCUB uses the rocPRIM
hipcub: library as the backend. However, on CUDA platforms it uses CUB instead.
