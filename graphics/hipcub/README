hipCUB is a thin wrapper library on top of rocPRIM or CUB. It enables
developers to port a project using the CUB library to the HIP layer to
run on AMD hardware.

In the ROCm environment, hipCUB uses the rocPRIM library as the backend.
However, on CUDA platforms it uses CUB instead.
By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./rocprim.SlackBuild
