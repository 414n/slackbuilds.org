The Composable Kernel (CK) library provides a programming model for
writing performance-critical kernels for machine learning workloads
across multiple architectures (GPUs, CPUs, etc.). The CK library uses
general purpose kernel languages, such as HIP C++.
By default this builds for all AMD GPU targets. You can limit the targets
by overriding the AMDGPU_TARGETS environment variable from the "all"
default to a list of semicolon-separated targets, i.e.:

AMDGPU_TARGETS="gfx803;gfx900" su -c ./composable-kernel.SlackBuild
