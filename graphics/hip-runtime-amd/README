ROCm is a brand name for the ROCm open software platform (for software)
or the ROCm open platform ecosystem (includes hardware like FPGAs or
other CPU architectures).

HIP is a C++ Runtime API and Kernel Language that allows developers to
create portable applications for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs from single source
code.

Key features include:

 - HIP is very thin and has little or no performance impact over coding
   directly in CUDA mode.

 - HIP allows coding in a single-source C++ programming language
   including features such as templates, C++11 lambdas, classes,
   namespaces, and more.

 - HIP allows developers to use the "best" development environment and
   tools on each target platform.
 
 - The HIPIFY tools automatically convert source from CUDA to HIP.

 - Developers can specialize for the platform (CUDA or AMD) to tune for
   performance or handle tricky cases.

graphviz and a java runtime are optional dependencies to compile the project
documentation.
