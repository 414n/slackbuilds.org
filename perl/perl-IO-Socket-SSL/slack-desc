# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-IO-Socket-SSL: perl-IO-Socket-SSL (SSL encapsulation for IO::Socket::INET)
perl-IO-Socket-SSL:
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: uses SSL to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: or client. IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: needs to write a full-featured SSL client or server application:
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: multiple SSL contexts, cipher selection, certificate verification, and
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: SSL version selection. As an extra bonus, it works perfectly with
perl-IO-Socket-SSL: mod_perl.
