This game is a tribute to Space Invaders, the famous arcade game
created by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978.

** Gameplay **

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player controls
a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the
screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five
rows of eleven aliens that move horizontally back and forth across
the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen.
The player's laser cannon is partially protected by several
stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed
from the top and bottom by blasts from either the aliens or the
cannon.

The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with
the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement
and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the aliens
on-screen brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which
can continue endlessly.

A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of
the screen and awards bonus points if destroyed.

The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing at it
while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the
bottom, the alien invasion is declared successful and the game
ends tragically (optionally you can choose to start the current
stage over); otherwise, it ends generally if the player's last
cannon is destroyed by the enemy's projectiles.
