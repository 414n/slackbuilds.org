This is a simple wrapper script that allows you to easily run Winetricks
commands for Steam Play/Proton games. This is often useful when a game requires
closed-source runtime libraries that are not included with Proton.

To make use of this, you'll need a winetricks installation and also a
Proton-enabled Steam client install.
