Okay, folks, it's that time again.  We're running a bit behind this time, 
  but we think (most of) the kinks are worked out at this point.   As we 
  announced on the mailing list a couple of days ago, we've spent a *lot* of 
  time and effort getting our entire repository into git, so everything is 
  now available there in addition to our "normal" offerings (http, ftp, and 
  rsync).  This has not been without a few hiccups along the way, and one of
  them is a mixed blessing: git keeps track of *everything*  :-)  As such, 
  it seems like too much time/effort involved in providing a ChangeLog *this*
  time to detail what's added, removed, patched, and so on; therefore, if 
  you are interested in that (and you should be), have a look here:
    http://slackbuilds.org/gitweb/?p=slackbuilds.git;a=log;h=refs/heads/13.1
  We'll be creating the usual "Slackware-style" ChangeLog.txt from this point
  forward, so don't get too excited about having to crawl the git logs... :-)
Anyway, I (rworkman) would like to take this opportunity to thank the other
  admins for all of the help with this, particularly: Heinz Wiesinger for 
  providing lots of git expertise and massive improvements to our "system"
  for managing submissions behind the scenes; Erik Hanson for an outstanding
  job managing the server; David Somero for test-building the entire tree on
  -current to find out what was broken; Ezra Free for popping in to fix the
  occasional "emergency" with the website code; Rob McGee for sitting in the
  shadows (well, mostly) making sure our DNS resolves correctly and our mail
  gets delivered; Michiel van Wessem for the "routine" stuff (and laughing
  at my lame jokes); and for the sake of completeness, Eric Hameleers and Alan
  Hicks for all of the little things that are so often overlooked and/or
  unrecognized but nonetheless necessary.  Thanks, guys - you are sincerely
  appreciated!
Finally, thanks to all of you readers for helping bring us to where we are
  today - obviously this applies to those of you who maintain various scripts
  in the repo, as those are the reason anyone visits the site - but it also
  applies to the "normal" users.  Thanks for the feedback, the bug reports,
  the fixes, the word-of-mouth recommendations on forums and mailing lists, 
  and so on - we appreciate your votes of confidence.  That being said, there
  are almost surely some bugs lurking in this first batch of public offerings,
  but maybe we can get those shaken out pretty quickly.  We're going to wait
  a few days (maybe even a week or so) before we open the submission form
  back up - this will give us time to knock out any bugs that are uncovered.
Enjoy!  --rworkman
