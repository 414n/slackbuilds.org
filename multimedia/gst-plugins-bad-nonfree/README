gst-plugins-bad-nonfree (encumbered set of GStreamer plugins)

GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual
wide use.

Since gst-plugins-bad-free is part of Slackware, this package only
includes the plugins that are not already in gst-plugins-bad-free.
Despite the -nonfree in the name, not all of these are encumbered:
some just aren't included in Slackware because it lacks the optional
dependencies.

This optionally depends on TiMidity++, aom, amrnb, amrwb, celt,
chromaprint, DirectFB, faac, faad2, flite, gsm, ladspa_sdk,
libass, libcdaudio, libdc1394, libdca, libfdk-aac, libkate, liblrdf,
libmimic, libmodplug, libmusicbrainz, libofa, libquicktime, libsrtp,
lv2, musepack-tools, nvidia*driver, rtmpdump, schroedinger, srt,
soundtouch, swfdec, x265, xvidcore, and zxing. And probably a few more
that we've missed.

Note that if you have any version of the nvidia drivers installed,
the script would autodetect them and will try to build its nvdec
support, requiring the presence on the system of cudatoolkit too. As
cudatoolkit is *huge*, cuda support is disabled by default but it can
be explicitly enabled passing the CUDA=yes in the environment.
