tceetree could be useful for you when:

 - you have the sources of an application written in C language;
 - you would like to have a graphical representation of the entire or partial
function call tree.

It relies on cscope (available in plain Slackware) to analyze source files.
The output it produces is meant to be feed to graphviz, so you'll likely need it
too.
