ispc is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with
extensions for "single program, multiple data" (SPMD) programming.

Under the SPMD model, the programmer writes a program that generally
appears to be a regular serial program, though the execution model is
actually that a number of program instances execute in parallel on the
hardware. (See the ispc documentation for more details and examples that
illustrate this concept.)

ispc compiles a C-based SPMD programming language to run on the SIMD
units of CPUs and GPUs; it frequently provides a 3x or more speedup on
architectures with 4-wide vector SSE units and 5x-6x on archituctures
with 8-wide AVX vector units, without any of the difficulty of writing
intrinsics code. 

Note: enabling GPU support requires the level-zero library
