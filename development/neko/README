Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language. It can be used as
an embedded scripting language. It has been designed to provide a common
runtime for several different languages. Learning and using Neko is very easy.
You can easily extend the language with C libraries. You can also write
generators from your own language to Neko and then use the Neko Runtime to
compile, run, and access existing libraries.
Neko has a compiler and a virtual machine. The Virtual Machine is both very
lightweight and well optimized, so it can run very quickly. The VM can be
easily embedded into any application and your libraries can be accessed using
the C foreign function interface.
