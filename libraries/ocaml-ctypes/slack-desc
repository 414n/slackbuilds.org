# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ocaml-ctypes: ocaml-ctypes - Combinators for binding to C libraries 
ocaml-ctypes:
ocaml-ctypes: ctypes is a library for binding to C libraries using pure OCaml. The
ocaml-ctypes: primary aim is to make writing C extensions as straightforward as possible.
ocaml-ctypes: The core of ctypes is a set of combinators for describing the
ocaml-ctypes: structure of C types -- numeric types, arrays, pointers, structs,
ocaml-ctypes: unions and functions. You can use these combinators to describe the
ocaml-ctypes: types of the functions that you want to call, then bind directly to
ocaml-ctypes: those functions -- all without writing or generating any C!
