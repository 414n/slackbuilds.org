Standard library for ppx rewriters

Ppxlib is the standard library for ppx rewriters and other programs that
manipulate the in-memory reprensation of OCaml programs, a.k.a the
"Parsetree".

It also comes bundled with two ppx rewriters that are commonly used to
write tools that manipulate and/or generate Parsetree values;
ppxlib.metaquot which allows to construct Parsetree values using the
OCaml syntax directly and ppxlib.traverse which provides various ways of
automatically traversing values of a given type, in particular allowing
to inject a complex structured value into generated code.
