# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

half: This is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant
half: 16-bit half-precision floating-point type along with corresponding
half: arithmetic operators, type conversions and common mathematical
half: functions. It aims for both efficiency and ease of use, trying to
