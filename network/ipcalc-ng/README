ipcalc-ng (An IP Netmask/broadcast/etc calculator)

This is a modern tool to assist in network address calculations
for IPv4 and IPv6. It acts both as a tool to output human readable
information about a network or address, as well as a tool suitable to
be used by scripts or other programs.

It supports printing a summary about the provided network address,
multiple command line options per information to be printed,
transparent IPv6 support, and in addition it can use GeoIP if
available to provide geographic information.

The project started as a fork of the ipcalc tool in the Fedora
distribution but it has since then replaced the original tool.

Conflict: ipcalc-ng cannot be installed at the same time as ipcalc.

Optional dependency: GeoIP. This is autodetected. It's required
for ipcalc-ng to give geographic info. The slack-desc and the
/var/log/packages file for ipcalc will tell you whether or not GeoIP
support is built in. Also, running "ipcalc --help" will show you the
"-g, --geoinfo" option if GeoIP support is included.

Note: Although ipcalc-ng can use libmaxminddb instead of GeoIP, the
SlackBuild maintainer was unable to get it to work, so it's disabled
in the build.
